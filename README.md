#purpose: 
jai\` is (just another) attempt at creating a self-regulating software engine with a survival instinct. the purpose of this software is for it be a distributed-engine- to perpetuate itself and to keep itself running and growing and learning - the engine itself is it's own prime directive and it's primary

#background:
What if modern software systems were programmed on-top of a self-scaling-infrastructure orchestrated by a compute-process-store controlled by 'purposed' software ??? I you would have a machine whose primary missions are to:

1) compute: keep its own compute-clusters running – (program it with a drive to survive and gift it with protected cloud resources).
2) store: maintain, store,  and execute its own self-learning software – (give it a reason to survive, something to remember, the ability to learn, and the ability to synthesize )
and;
3) choose: use ‘rules/no-rules’ decision trees and occasionally choose one at random – (motivation - give the machine a way to self-learn) 

I think that’s the general blueprint on how to architect a true machine intelligence.  It’s easy really, all you need is secure compute and communication clouds with guaranteed power and a self-healing auto-scaling grid…    
In the real world, that kind of system is pretty much there – there’s a lot of blur between governments, infrastructure, ‘the cloud’ industry, and business and it’s hard to tell what is what any more. But we have probably already created machine intelligence, and likely aren’t even aware of it.
